To get my system situated

- `bootstrap-osx.sh` to get fresh system setup with basics (Git, Python, Ansible, Zsh, Oh-My-Zsh)
- `configure-osx.sh` after that to run Ansible and apply all [roles](https://github.com/icole/dotfiles/tree/master/ansible/roles) locally.
- Which roles are run can be configured [here](https://github.com/icole/dotfiles/blob/master/ansible/setup.yml)
